# PDF Name List
In support of ISO 32000, Adobe maintains this list of the prefixes of second class names for PDF.  It is freely open to all developers and organizations following the specifications given in Annex E of ISO 32000. 

## Instructions
### Adding a new prefix
Create a new Issue, filling out the template to register the prefix you want to reserve. Assuming that the name has not been used already, it will be added to the publicly available XLSX file and you will receive an email confirmation.  If there is a conflict, you will be notified and can select an alternative.

If you wish to add multiple prefixes for your organization, please create one issue per prefix.

### Updating an existing prefix
Create a new Issue, filling out the template with the updated information. Please add any instructions, such as instructing Adobe to make a previously private listing public, add that in the *Additional Instructions* section.


## Additional Details
The XLSX file in this repository contains all developer prefixes that have been added to the list since 2008 (when ISO 32000-1 was published).  This document is maintained by the maintainers of this repository and no PRs to change it will be accepted.  
>NOTE: Due to legal reasons, Adobe maintains the list of all registrations that occured prior to that 2008.
